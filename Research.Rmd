# Working Paper

#### **Fire Sale Risk and Mortgage Origination**, with D.Bongaerts and W.Wagner, 2020

Abstract: This paper examines the inclusion of disorderly collateral liquidations into lending decisions. %In line with previous literature on endogenous fire-sales, For identification, we exploit the universe of U.S. mortgage applications and variation in foreclosure frictions. Lenders' incentives to supply credit decrease in their \textit{ex post} incentives to absorb adverse spillovers of foreclosures, in their portfolio similarity with other market participants and in the dispersion of mortgages outstanding. We corroborate these results exploiting exogenous shocks from bank mergers, finding stronger effects for balance sheet-constrained lenders and providing evidence that mortgage interest rate is charged accordingly. The anticipation of fire-sale risk has important consequences for overall credit, as lenders divert capital away from prone-to-fire sales markets, improving financial stability going forward.

#### **Closed For Business**, with D.Bongaerts and W.Wagner, 2020

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of business shutdowns to contain the Covid-19 disease. In March 2020, Italy shut down operations in a number of sectors. Using a difference-in-difference approach, we find that municipalities
with higher exposure to closed sectors experience subsequently lower mortality rates. We estimate the resulting life savings to exceed 12.000 people over less than a month. Using estimates of remaining life-years, this translates
into monetary benefits of 12 billion Euros We also show that business shutdowns exhibit rapidly diminishing returns and generate spillover effects outside the closed sectors as well as in other municipalities. This suggests that effective containment policies require central coordination.
